- **Improve Order Book Display**: 
  - Enhance the visibility of order book levels by implementing a padded display method.
  - Adjust the heatmap brightness coloring to focus on the "visible" range or a percentage around the current price, rather than the entire order book. This will prevent large, distant orders from skewing the color range and ensure that spread prices are more distinguishable.

- **Order Book Aggregation**:
  - Implement a group aggregation feature for the live order book by tick size. This will help in summarizing the order book data more effectively and provide a clearer view of market depth.

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Add more UI buttons to improve user interaction and accessibility of features.
  - Integrate a timeframe dropdown menu that allows users to change the order book and candlestick aggregation logic dynamically. This will enable users to customize their view based on different timeframes and trading strategies.
