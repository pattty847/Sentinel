# Sentinel Status

Current facts only: replace old facts, do not append a journal. History is `git log --first-parent` and
`_agent/`. Rules: `AGENTS.md`. Update at landings, deploys, owner decisions and wave ends. Keep under 8 KB.

- **Updated:** 2026-11-08, wave 3 dispatched. **main** pushed (see `git log -1`). Work order: `docs/TODO.md` Waves.
- **Conductor:** Claude Opus 5.5, wave 3 (started 2026-11-08).
- **Review policy:** 1 + 1 cross-provider (AGENTS.md section 10); Fable for high risk. Owner 2026-11-05: spend all Codex, including reset credits before they expire.

## Next

1. Wave 3: review the Fable "why it moved" plan when it returns; dispatch its first slices. Palette replacement waits for the owner's colour variants; axis drag snap-back is not dispatched yet.
2. With the owner present: build main, then `scripts/dev/deploy-runtime.sh server` for the trade-id window `87c9ccbc` (no format change). The script refuses a stale or dirty build.
3. After landing any GUI change, build main: the owner's GUI loads QML from the source tree, so a stale binary fails to load the chart.
4. Squash any branch whose history touched `docs/TODO.md` before land (AGENTS section 7).

## Services (owner's Mac, launchd)

- **Server** (`com.sentinel.recorder`): pid 97899, built from `037021cd`, deployed 2026-11-08 18:03 EST. Not yet deployed: `87c9ccbc` trade-id window. Startup replays the journal from UTC midnight minus margin to rebuild open 1m..1d bars (BTC ~21-27 s; that product's live feed waits).
- **Capture** (`com.sentinel.capture`): binary from 2026-10-03; 7 products; fan-out to the server. Rollback: `deploy-runtime.sh rollback capture`.
- **Monitoring:** VictoriaMetrics :8428, Grafana :3000 (alerts include live feed down, roller retry exhausted), tailnet only via `tailscale serve`; public Funnel off. Grafana loads alert rules only on restart (`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.sentinel.grafana`).
- **Shadow self-check** (owner: keep it): hourly checks roll only the new hour from the oracle's anchor; oracle at `hmc2/shadow-oracle/<product>/<dayMs>` (current day only; exclude from backups).
- Startup `Shadow journal invalidated ... reason=journal boundary` warnings at server start are routine.

## Land gate

`agent-worktree.sh land` checks out a private verified clone on T7, rebases, runs chart-health, doc-health, the build and full `ctest` with `SENTINEL_REQUIRE_GPU=1`, then merges `--no-ff` the tested SHA. Evidence per attempt in `~/Library/Logs/Sentinel/land/<attempt-id>/`. Exit 4 = merged but evidence incomplete: finish with `agent-worktree.sh remove <branch>`, never re-land. Chart slices: native `SENTINEL_REQUIRE_GPU=1` ChartGolden/ChartUi/UgrGpu before READY.

## In flight

- **Fable plan** (no code): footprint, CVD, eaten/pulled, trade bubbles -> `../Sentinel-Private/research/2026-11-08-why-it-moved-plan.md` (Claude subagent, running).
- `lt-claude/heatmap-seam` (worktree `/Volumes/T7/sentinel-worktrees/lt-claude-heatmap-seam`): seam left of the now column. Writer Claude Opus subagent; reviewer gpt-6-astra. HIGH. Owns HeatmapGpuLayer, HeatmapSourceController. Phase: writing.
- `lt-astra/heatmap-saturation` (worktree `/Volumes/T7/sentinel-worktrees/lt-astra-heatmap-saturation`): size saturation (PEPE) + zoom-out smoothing setting (default off). Writer gpt-6-astra thread `01a1be15-f436-7d21-8eaa-b2a3cfe59f36`; reviewer Fable. HIGH; Metal evidence from the conductor. Owns palette, shaders, HeatmapLayer, settings. Phase: writing.

Lab branches that never land: `lt-astra/hmc2-rollup-lab`, `lt-claude/hmc2-layout-lab` (results in `/Volumes/T7/sentinel-datalab/hmc2-*`).

## Waiting on the owner

1. **v3.0.0-alpha macOS release:** branch `lt-claude/mac-release-v3` tip `5082065a`, review PASS (gpt-6-astra thread `01a16c06-c945-7260-89c1-cafa71c6f81b`); waits on the owner's second-account test of the zip in `/Users/Shared/Sentinel-alpha-test/` (`TEST-STEPS.md`). Then land, release notes, tag only on the owner's yes.
2. Revoke the old Coinbase key; then the conductor deletes `key.json` at the next restart. Decide the config overlay question (Sentinel-Private security notes).

## Owner constraints in force

- Builds and tests run `-j 6` through the FIFO build queue, one at a time. No automated GUI windows while the owner works at the Mac unless asked.
- The owner hardens `scripts/dev/build-queue.sh` and its tests (FM-195); agents do not change them.
- Docs archive on the T7: `/Volumes/T7/sentinel-backup/docs-archive/`.
