The documents detail significant progress in developing the Sentinel GPU charting terminal, focusing on performance, visual quality, and architectural improvements. Key achievements include:


   * Core GPU Foundation & Performance:
       * Established a stable Metal backend with Qt SceneGraph, utilizing VBO triple-buffering and lock-free operations for real-time data processing.
       * Achieved exceptional performance, maintaining sub-3ms GPU rendering and processing over 2.27 million trades per second.
       * Implemented a robust real-time data pipeline with live WebSocket integration to Coinbase.


   * Visual Enhancements & Coordinate System:
       * Successfully implemented a professional-grade gradient color system for the heatmap, adapting to order book volume intensity.
       * Introduced adaptive screen-space sizing for trade points, reducing visual gaps during zooming.
       * Crucially, resolved a major candle coordinate synchronization issue, ensuring all rendering layers (trades, heatmap, candles) align perfectly and dynamically adjust to real-time price ranges.
       * Implemented smooth, three-color (uptick, downtick, no change) circle geometry for trade visualization, replacing previous rectangular representations.


   * Architectural Refinements & Bug Fixes:
       * Addressed a critical timing frequency mismatch for candlesticks by integrating them into the GPUDataAdapter's 16ms batching pipeline and introducing high-frequency candle timeframes (100ms, 500ms, 1s).
       * Initiated a multi-mode chart architecture plan to allow toggleable visualization modes (trade scatter, various candle timeframes, order book heatmap, hybrid views).
       * Identified and isolated a segmentation fault related to Qt Scene Graph during candle rendering, confirming it's an internal Qt issue rather than an application logic flaw, and ensuring the core system
         remains stable even with this isolated bug.
       * Cleaned up CandlestickBatched to act as a pure renderer, removing data processing logic and streamlining its interface.
       * Fixed various linter errors and type mismatches to improve code quality and stability.


  In essence, the project has moved from a basic GPU rendering proof-of-concept to a high-performance, visually sophisticated, and architecturally sound real-time financial charting application, with a clear
  roadmap for future features and optimizations.
