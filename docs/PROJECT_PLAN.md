# Sentinel C++: Project Roadmap & Development Plan

## üéØ **Mission Statement**

Transform Sentinel into a **professional-grade market microstructure analysis platform** with real-time visualizations that rival tools like BookMap, aterm, and TradingView for cryptocurrency markets.

---

## üìã **Completed Phases** ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Phase 1-4: Foundation (Pre-December 2024)
- **Object-oriented refactoring** from single-file script
- **Core logic implementation** (CVD, Rules Engine, Statistics)
- **Multi-threading architecture** with responsive GUI
- **Qt Controller pattern** for framework decoupling

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: High-Performance Streaming (December 2024)
- **CoinbaseStreamClient rewrite** for production-grade performance
- **Trade deduplication** using Coinbase trade_id system
- **Dual-speed modes** (full-hose vs controlled polling)
- **Robust JSON parsing** with mixed type handling
- **Thread-safe buffers** with configurable limits

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Bridge Integration (December June 2025) üöÄ
- **StreamController bridge** connecting C++ engine to Qt GUI
- **Real-time signal/slot** integration at sub-100ms latency
- **Multi-symbol streaming** (BTC-USD + ETH-USD)
- **Production stability** with clean lifecycle management
- **Live CVD updates** and alert system integration

### ‚úÖ Phase 7: Real-Time Charting Engine (June 2025) üìà
- **Custom `TradeChartWidget`** for high-performance rendering
- **Dynamic Axes** with price and time labels and grid lines
- **Multi-Layered Drawing** of price line and trade flow dots
- **Symbol Filtering** to display a single, clean data stream

### ‚úÖ Phase 8: Professional Project Structure (June 2025) üèóÔ∏è
- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored the entire project from a flat `src/` directory into a professional `libs/` and `apps/` structure.
- **Created `sentinel_core` Library**: Isolated all non-GUI, high-performance logic (data processing, streaming, rules) into a reusable static library.
- **Created `sentinel_gui_lib` Library**: Isolated all Qt-specific components (MainWindow, ChartWidget, StreamController) into a dedicated GUI library.
- **Modernized Build System**: Rewrote the entire `CMakeLists.txt` hierarchy to be modular, using modern CMake practices (`target_link_libraries` with `PUBLIC`/`PRIVATE`, `add_subdirectory`).
- **Dependency Management**: Successfully diagnosed and fixed missing system dependencies (`qt6-charts-dev`, `libboost-program-options-dev`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`, `nlohmann-json3-dev`).
- **Dual Executables**: The build system now produces two distinct targets: `sentinel` (the full GUI) and `sentinel_stream` (the command-line tool).
