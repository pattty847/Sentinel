# CoinbaseStreamClient Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Transform the monolithic `CoinbaseStreamClient` into a modular, testable architecture following Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

## Current Issues
- **God Class**: Single class handles networking, auth, parsing, storage, logging, threading
- **Concurrency**: Global mutex serializes all lookups causing contention
- **Performance**: O(log n) std::map, repeated JSON parsing, large vector copies
- **Memory**: Manual stream lifecycle, no RAII guarantees
- **Threading**: Manual thread management, IO thread blocking on reconnection

## Target Architecture
```

 │ CoinbaseStreamClient │  ← Facade (public API unchanged)
 └───────┬──────────────┘
         │delegates
 ┌───────┴───────────┐
 │  MarketDataCore   │  ← owns io_context + ws stream
 └─┬────────┬───────┬┘

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing public API methods work identically

- [ ] GUI components work without modification

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Reduced memory usage (bounded by ring buffers)
- [ ] Lower latency (O(1) lookups, shared_mutex)
- [ ] Better testability (each component unit testable)
- [ ] Cleaner shutdown (RAII throughout)
- [ ] Easier to extend (add new channels/features)

## Rollback Plan
- Keep original implementation in `coinbasestreamclient_legacy.cpp`
- Use feature flags to switch between implementations
- Comprehensive testing before removing legacy code

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement each phase incrementally
- Maintain compilation at each step
- Extensive testing between phases
- Can pause/resume work at any phase boundary

## Timeline Estimation
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 hours (headers + CMake)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (Authenticator)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 hours (DataCache + ring buffer)
- **Phase 4**: 4-6 hours (MarketDataCore networking)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 hours (Facade refactoring)
- **Phase 6**: 3-4 hours (Testing)
- **Phase 7**: 2-3 hours (Cleanup)

**Total**: ~17-25 hours across multiple sessions
