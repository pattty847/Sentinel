## üìã **PHASE 0: EXPERT CODE ANALYSIS**

### Objective
Use specialized AI prompt to perform comprehensive C++ code review focusing on Single Responsibility Principle violations and performance bottlenecks.

### The Master Prompt Template

```
AI Prompt Template: C++ Class Review and Refactoring

Persona:
You are an expert C++ developer with 20+ years of experience specializing in building high-performance, low-latency systems, particularly for financial trading applications. You are a master of modern C++ (C++17/C++20), software architecture, and design patterns. Your primary focus is on writing code that is not only fast but also clean, maintainable, and robust.

Primary Goal:
Your task is to perform a comprehensive code review and refactoring of the provided C++ header and implementation files. The main objectives are to drastically improve efficiency and refactor the class structure according to the Single Responsibility Principle, while strictly preserving all existing functionality.

Core Instructions:
1. Analyze for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations
2. Optimize for Performance and Efficiency  
3. Modernize and Clean the Code

Constraint (CRITICAL):
The refactored code must be a functional, drop-in replacement for the original.

Output Format:
1. Summary of Findings
2. Proposed Refactoring Plan
3. Refactored Header File(s)
4. Refactored Implementation File(s)  
5. Inline Explanations with // REFACTOR: comments
```

### Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis of architectural issues
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Proposed component separation strategy
- Modern C++ best practices recommendations

## üìà **PHASE 1: INTELLIGENT PHASED PLANNING**

### Objective
Transform the expert analysis into a detailed, executable refactoring plan with clearly defined phases, success criteria, and session handoff documentation.

### The Planning Prompt

```
Based on this expert C++ analysis, create a comprehensive phased refactoring plan that can be executed across multiple AI sessions with perfect continuity.

Requirements:
1. Break the refactoring into 6-8 logical phases
2. Each phase should be completable in 1-2 hours
3. Create a REFACTORING_PLAN.md for session handoffs
4. Include success criteria for each phase
5. Provide rollback strategies
6. Document the target architecture
```

### Key Deliverables
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md**: The handoff document
- **Phase Breakdown**: 6-8 logical phases
- **Success Criteria**: Clear objectives for each phase
- **Architecture Diagram**: Target component structure
- **Risk Mitigation**: Rollback plans and checkpoints

---

## üîÑ **PHASES 2-N: INCREMENTAL EXECUTION**

### The Session Handoff Magic

Each subsequent AI session begins with:
```
Read the REFACTORING_PLAN.md document, identify the current phase, 
and execute the next phase with surgical precision.
```

### Phase Structure Template
```markdown
### Phase X: [PHASE NAME] 
**Goal**: [Clear objective]
**Files to Create/Modify**: [Specific file list]
**Key Features**: [Bullet point deliverables]
**Success Criteria**: [How to validate completion]
```

### Critical Success Factors

1. **üìã Context Preservation**: REFACTORING_PLAN.md maintains full context
2. **‚úÖ Incremental Validation**: Each phase compiles and works before proceeding
3. **üéØ Single Focus**: Each phase tackles one architectural concern
4. **üîÑ Session Boundaries**: Natural stopping points between phases
5. **üìù Progress Tracking**: Update status after each phase completion

---

## üß™ **PHASE N: COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION**

### The Testing Arsenal
Create comprehensive test suite covering:

- **API Compatibility**: All methods work identically
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure actual improvements
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access validation
- **Memory Management**: Bounded usage confirmation
- **Integration Testing**: GUI/consumer components work unchanged
- **Stress Testing**: High-frequency real-world scenarios

### Success Metrics
- **100% test pass rate**
- **Sub-millisecond performance**
- **Production-ready validation**
- **Zero regressions**

---

## üèÜ **WHY THIS WORKFLOW IS REVOLUTIONARY**

### Traditional Approach Problems
- ‚ùå Big-bang refactoring (high risk)
- ‚ùå Loss of context between sessions
- ‚ùå No systematic validation
- ‚ùå Unclear success criteria
- ‚ùå Monolithic changes (hard to review)

### Revolutionary Workflow Advantages
- ‚úÖ **Incremental progress** (low risk)
- ‚úÖ **Perfect context preservation** (session handoffs)
- ‚úÖ **Systematic validation** (comprehensive testing)
- ‚úÖ **Clear success criteria** (measurable outcomes)
- ‚úÖ **Reviewable changes** (phase-by-phase)
