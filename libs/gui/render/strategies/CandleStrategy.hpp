/*
Sentinel â€” CandleStrategy
Role: A concrete render strategy that visualizes market data as OHLC candlesticks.
Inputs/Outputs: Implements IRenderStrategy to turn a GridSliceBatch into a QSGNode of lines.
Threading: Methods are called exclusively on the Qt Quick render thread.
Performance: Renders all geometry into a single QSGNode for efficiency.
Integration: Instantiated and managed by UnifiedGridRenderer as a pluggable strategy.
Observability: No internal logging.
Related: CandleStrategy.cpp, IRenderStrategy.hpp, UnifiedGridRenderer.h, GridTypes.hpp.
Assumptions: Input cells contain OHLC data in their 'customData' map.
