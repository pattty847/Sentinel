/*
Sentinel â€” HeatmapStrategy
Role: A concrete render strategy that visualizes market liquidity as a heatmap.
Inputs/Outputs: Implements IRenderStrategy to turn a GridSliceBatch into a colored QSGNode.
Threading: Methods are called exclusively on the Qt Quick render thread.
Performance: Stateless. Generates six vertices per grid cell in the provided batch.
Integration: Instantiated and managed by UnifiedGridRenderer as a pluggable strategy.
Observability: No internal logging.
Related: HeatmapStrategy.cpp, IRenderStrategy.hpp, UnifiedGridRenderer.h, GridTypes.hpp.
Assumptions: The input batch contains valid cell data with pre-calculated screen rectangles.
