/*
Sentinel â€” IRenderStrategy
Role: Defines the abstract interface for all rendering strategies.
Inputs/Outputs: Defines the contract for turning a GridSliceBatch into a renderable QSGNode.
Threading: Methods are designed to be called on the Qt Quick render thread.
Performance: Interface is designed for batch operations to optimize rendering performance.
Integration: Implemented by concrete strategies (e.g., HeatmapStrategy) and used by UnifiedGridRenderer.
Observability: No diagnostics defined; responsibility of the concrete implementation.
Related: UnifiedGridRenderer.h, GridTypes.hpp, HeatmapStrategy.hpp, TradeFlowStrategy.hpp.
Assumptions: Implementations will be managed and invoked by UnifiedGridRenderer.
