# AGENTS.md — Sentinel Agent Operating Rules (Slim)

Source of truth for coding agents working on Sentinel.
Default goal: make the requested change safely, with minimal context and minimal churn.

Machine: Windows 11
Build: `cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-vs`

## 0) Fast Start (Read Minimum First)

Use the smallest context that can solve the task.

Modes:
- **Lite** (questions, docs, tooling, no code edits): do not preload `_agent/` or `docs/TODO.md`
- **CodeChange** (implement/refactor): read `_agent/INVARIANTS.md`
- **Debug/Perf/Regression**: read `_agent/INVARIANTS.md` + `_agent/FAILURE_MODES.md`

Rules:
- Start with targeted search (`rg -n`, `rg --files`), not broad file reads.
- Before first concrete action, read at most ~200 lines total unless user asks for deep review.
- If request is ambiguous, start in Lite mode and escalate only if needed.
- If you discover a durable invariant/failure mode/decision, update `_agent/` before stopping.

## 1) Sentinel Non-Negotiables (Core Identity)

Protect these at all times:
- **Core stays pure C++** (no Qt contamination in core, except explicitly tolerated utility types if already established)
- **GUI owns Qt/QML/QSG behavior**
- **Rendering is GPU-first, deterministic, and low-lag**

Prefer simpler/faster designs over preserving weak legacy patterns unless compatibility is explicitly required.

## 2) Critical Invariants

- **Viewport updates must go through `setViewport()`** so `viewportVersion` increments.
  Do not mutate viewport fields directly. If `viewportVersion` does not change, rebuild logic can fail.

- **Threading**
  - Network and data processing stay off GUI thread
  - Cross-thread communication uses `Qt::QueuedConnection`
  - QSG/render-thread code must not touch GUI `QObject` graphs

- **Render path behavior**
  - Preallocate/reuse QSG geometry and nodes where practical
  - Validate inputs (skip NaN/inf)
  - Avoid unnecessary node/geometry churn in hot paths

## 3) Where Things Belong (Ownership Boundaries)

- `libs/core`: market data transport, dispatchers, order books, DTOs, transforms (non-UI logic)
- `libs/gui`: Qt/QML/QSG, rendering strategies, window/widget behavior
- `apps/`: thin bootstraps only (no business logic)

If a change crosses these boundaries, stop and justify it before proceeding.

## 4) Commands (Use These First)

Build:
- `cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-vs`

Runtime/testing:
- Prefer targeted validation for touched area first
- Full-suite or long-running passes only if requested or clearly necessary

Cheap verification ladder:
1. Format/lint touched scope only
2. Build affected target(s)
3. Run targeted tests / targeted repro
4. Ask before broad/full runs unless user asked for it

## 5) Hot Paths (Treat Like Live Wires)

Changes here require performance caution and small diffs:
- `DataProcessor`
- `HeatmapTwapStreamer`
- `HeatmapLabelRenderer`
- QSG geometry updates

Before editing hot paths, explicitly check for per-frame risk:
- allocations
- object creation/destruction
- signal emissions
- binding churn / unnecessary recomputation

## 6) Agent Memory (`_agent/`) — Durable, Minimal, One-Line

Path: `_agent/` (gitignored AI scratchpad)

Files:
- `_agent/INVARIANTS.md` → `- INV-### | <statement>`
- `_agent/FAILURE_MODES.md` → `- FM-### | Symptom: <...> | Root: <...> | Guardrail: <...>`
- `_agent/REPO_MAP.md` → `- AREA: <path> | Owns: <...> | Touch with: <...> | Notes: <...>`
- `_agent/DECISIONS.md` → `- YYYY-MM-DD | Decision | Why: <...> | Rejected: <...>`

Rules:
- One line per entry, ASCII only
- Do not add new `_agent` files unless user asks
- Prefer durable guardrails over session chatter
- Qdrant indexing is directory-targeted only (`libs/`, `docs/`, optional source dirs), never repo root, never `build/`

## 7) Task Tracking (`docs/TODO.md`) — Only When Relevant

Read/update `docs/TODO.md` only when:
- user asks for TODO / feature / session-log work
- task changes scope or priorities
- ending session and log update is needed

Use targeted reads, not full dumps.
Do not reorder or renumber feature blocks.

## 8) Canonical Docs to Update When Needed

Update only the relevant canonical doc in the same change:
- Protocol / wire / DTO semantics → `docs/MARKETDATA.md`
- Architecture / ownership / dependency direction → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Feature scope/progress → `docs/TODO.md`
- Config keys/defaults/semantics → config docs (if present)
- New durable invariant/regression guardrail → `_agent/INVARIANTS.md` or `_agent/FAILURE_MODES.md`
- Non-trivial design decision → `_agent/DECISIONS.md` (vault detail optional)

## 9) References (Read on Demand Not By Default)

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/MARKETDATA.md`
- `docs/TODO.md`

Read these only if the task actually needs them.
