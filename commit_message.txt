Implement dockable widget framework with theme management system

Transform MainWindow to QMainWindow with comprehensive docking system:
- DockablePanel base class for consistent dock behavior and symbol propagation
- Layout persistence with QSettings for workspace management
- HeatmapDock with embedded symbol controls for unified trading experience
- MarketDataPanel, SecFilingDock, Commentary feeds with intelligent positioning
- StatusBar integration with real-time metrics display

Add theme management infrastructure:
- ITheme interface for pluggable theme system
- ThemeManager singleton with registration and switching capabilities  
- DarkTheme implementation with trader-focused styling
- Runtime theme switching without application restart

Architecture improvements:
- Service locator pattern for clean dependency injection
- Thread-safe symbol change propagation across all docks
- Modular widget structure following Sentinel's core/gui separation
- CMake integration for new widget and theme libraries

This enables professional trading workstation layouts with Bloomberg-style
docking capabilities while maintaining GPU rendering performance.
