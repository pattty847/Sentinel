# Repository Guidelines

## Mission & Scope
Sentinel is a C++20 trading terminal with a hard separation between pure core logic, Qt-based adapters, and thin app entry points. Every contribution should preserve low-latency data handling, GPU-driven visualization, and modular maintainability.

## Architecture Boundaries & Constraints
- Keep `libs/core` free of Qt (QtCore only), `libs/gui` as adapter/render layers, and `apps/` limited to bootstrapping.
- Treat 500 LOC as the soft ceiling (warn above 450); crossing 500 requires a refactor plan or justification.
- Respect thread ownership: network/IO off the GUI thread, UI updates via queued signals, lock-free queues for cross-thread handoffs.
- Use the categorized logging system (`SentinelLogging.hpp/.cpp`) with `sentinel.app|data|render|debug`; avoid temporary or secret-bearing logs.

## Project Layout
- `libs/core/marketdata`: Transport, dispatcher, auth, cache, and sink adapters for the data pipeline.
- `libs/gui`: UnifiedGridRenderer façade, GridViewState, DataProcessor, render strategies, and QML controls.
- `apps/`: `sentinel_gui` and `stream_cli` entry points only.
- `tests/`: Legacy suites exist, but only `tests/marketdata` is currently wired into CMake. Stage new coverage here until the broader matrix is revived.
- `docs/`: Architecture and refactor guidance (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/sockets-auth-cache-refactor.md`, `docs/LOGGING_GUIDE.md`).
- `scripts/`: Tooling and code-analysis helpers (`scripts/README_CODE_ANALYSIS.md`).

## Build & Test Workflow
- Configure/build via `cmake --preset <preset>` followed by `cmake --build --preset <preset>` (mac-clang, linux-gcc, windows-mingw).
- Run active tests with `cmake --build --preset <preset> --target marketdata_tests` or `ctest --preset <preset> --output-on-failure`.
- Launch the GUI using `./build-<preset>/apps/sentinel_gui/sentinel_gui`.
- Need a snapshot of a large file before diving in? Use the analysis utilities (`quick_cpp_overview.sh`, `extract_functions.sh`) documented in `scripts/README_CODE_ANALYSIS.md` for a quick pass at function lists or structure.

## Coding Style & Expectations
- Favor modern C++20 idioms: RAII, smart pointers, standard library first; reach for Qt types only at integration seams.
- Formatting: 4-space indent, Qt brace style for classes, headers as `.hpp`; classes/enums in `PascalCase`, methods/signals `camelCase`, private members `m_`, constants `kPascalCase`.
- Keep cross-domain DTOs lightweight and avoid business logic in GUI layers.
- Comment intent when the domain is subtle; otherwise rely on expressive naming.

## Quality Gates
- No pull request without a passing build and `ctest`.
- Add or update tests with the code change; keep runs deterministic (mock transports, reuse fixtures).
- Watch for performance regressions on hot paths and call them out in PR notes if unavoidable.
- Document migrations, manual steps, and UI screenshots in commits/PRs, following the `Component: concise change` convention.

# Sentinel Architecture Details

Sentinel models exchange feeds as a dense time/price grid rendered on the GPU. Keep the data path deterministic, exchange-agnostic, and safe for both GUI and headless runtimes.

## Data Pipeline
```
Exchange WS → BeastWsTransport → MessageDispatcher → DataCache/DataCacheSinkAdapter
            (worker thread)        (worker thread)         (shared state)

DataCache → DataProcessor → LiquidityTimeSeriesEngine → UnifiedGridRenderer
(Qt queued to GUI thread)      (GUI thread aggregation)      (QML façade)

UnifiedGridRenderer → Render Strategy → GridSceneNode → GPU
             (per-mode geometry)        (Qt Scene Graph)
```

## Layer Highlights
- **Transport (`marketdata/ws`)**: TLS handshakes, reconnect backoff, heartbeats, and deterministic subscription frames via `SubscriptionManager`.
- **Dispatch (`marketdata/dispatch`)**: Parses provider payloads, surfaces acks/errors, and normalizes trade/book events before they hit the cache.
- **Cache (`marketdata/cache`)**: Thread-safe recent trades and live order books exposed through `DataCacheSinkAdapter` and DTOs.
- **Aggregation & Rendering (`libs/gui/render`)**: DataProcessor pulls from the cache, LiquidityTimeSeriesEngine builds multi-timeframe cells, and strategies convert them into GPU buffers managed by Qt Scene Graph nodes.

## Testing & Documentation
- Add market data tests under `tests/marketdata`; other suites remain offline until modernized.
- For transport/cache evolution, consult `docs/sockets-auth-cache-refactor.md` to stay aligned with the phased refactor plan.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` expands on the render stack, while `docs/LOGGING_GUIDE.md` covers logging categories and verbosity controls.

Preserve these boundaries and the GPU-first focus when extending Sentinel.
